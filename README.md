## Grocery App ##
The Grocery app connects users with small, local markets, encouraging connections to the community and supporting local businesses. In today's world, everyone are after the giant super markets like Walmart, Costco etc. They are ignoring the local markets giving a hard time for vendors who relied on these businesses for a long time. So, this app helps to address this gap between people and local vendors. The app, which was created using React Native for cross-platform compatibility, provides a simple user experience. Users check in and are then given with a Home Screen that displays a selection of nearby local establishments, such as Indian marketplaces or neighborhood grocers. After choosing a store, consumers may explore a curated selection of items, each with extensive descriptions and photographs to help them make an informed purchase. Adding products to the cart is straightforward, with a single tap triggering an alert verifying the addition. Behind the scenes, the app coordinates delivery logistics with local marketplaces, providing prompt and dependable service. Overall, our aim is to provide a convenient platform that promotes community engagement and supports the sustainability of local economies.
